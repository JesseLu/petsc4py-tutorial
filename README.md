Purpose
=======

A set of walk-throughs to gradually learn how to use PETSc via the petsc4py
package.


Contents
========

1.  vec_serial.py - work with vectors on a single process.
1.  mat_serial.py - work with matrices on a single process.
1.  ksp_serial.py - solve a linear system on a single process.
1.  da_serial.py - work with distributed arrays on a single process.


Current Issues
==============

1.  Document ksp_serial.py
1.  Re-code da to be a 2D version of the ksp solve.



Issues for Later
================

1.  Remove "long way" comments in serial codes.
