Purpose
=======

A set of walk-throughs to gradually learn how to use PETSc via the petsc4py
package.


Contents
========

1.  vec_serial.py - work with vectors on a single process.
1.  mat_serial.py - work with matrices on a single process.
1.  ksp_serial.py - solve a linear system on a single process.
1.  da_serial.py - work with distributed arrays on a single process.
1.  da_maxwell_serial.py - solving maxwell's equations.


Current Issues
==============

1.  Implement a 2D E&M solver (that will work well with both modes).


Issues for Later
================

1.  Remove "long way" comments in serial codes.
1.  Do something with the maxwell 3D code.
